# To Do

Not standard practice to keep a to do list with the code base, but hey - I'm working on this all on my lonesome so why not? List is in approx. priority order and defines steps to reach MVP:

1. Implement subdivision support (i.e. quavers, semi-quavers etc.)
2. Implement 2 new oscillators for the bell and beat tones and include in sequence
3. Use argparsing library to create CLI interface

MVP COMPLETE

Future considerations:

1. Performance optimsation
2. Multiple waveforms
4. Multi-oscillator synths
3. Filters
5. FM synthesis
6. PD synthesis
