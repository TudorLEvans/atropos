# Contributing

I welcome contributions!

If you want to contribute, here are some general rules to follow:

1. All branches should be named with the convention `{branch_type}/{branch_summary}` - for example, `feature/add-fm-synthesis`, `bugfix/integer-overflow-in-counter`
2. All PRs should have helpful descriptions of there purpose
3. All PRs should be accompanied by an addition to the CHANGELOG.md in the Unreleased section, unless they only rectify bugs found pre-release
4. Release = tag - in future, if this project reaches any kind of maturity (I might just lost interest...) tagging will trigger a pipeline to build and release the executable
5. In future, once tests have been integrate into the code, all PRs must have test coverage for their code
6. If your work changes anything in my janky TODO.md file, please update the file :)
7. Have fun! It's mandatory
